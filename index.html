      destination for traditional Mexican cuisine, signature craft cocktails,
      and immersive educational experiences such as <i>Taste of Tequila</i>. A
      true hospitality experience is defined by more than just great food and
      drinks — it’s about creating a inviting atmosphere, delivering top-shelf

      <p>
        Since Distrito’s inception, our goal has been to craft extraordinary
        drinks using the freshest ingredients. As a standard, we process all
        juices in-house and prepare each cocktail with professional precision
        and care. Creating specialty drinks is our passion, and each one is
        designed to leave you with a memorable experience you’ll want to
        revisit. Some of our most popular selections include the Lucid Dream—a
        clarified pear and matcha cocktail; 24 Carrot—a tequila-based drink
        featuring freshly juiced carrot and habanero-infused honey; and our
        signature Mexican Carajillo, a beloved favorite among guests and staff
        alike. Reserve a spot or stop by today!
