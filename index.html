    <p>
      Welcome to Distrito Federal — a hidden gem of the Bay Area. Founded in
      2022 by Issac Barrera, Distrito Federal has quickly become the go-to
      destination for both elevated and traditional Mexican cuisine, signature
      craft cocktails, and immersive educational experiences like Taste of
      Tequila. A true hospitality experience is defined by more than just great
      food and drinks — it’s about creating a unique, classy atmosphere,
      delivering top-shelf service, and showcasing professional expertise in
      every way. Distrito Federal brings all three of these necessities together
      in one top-notch establishment.

      <h2>Cuisine</h2>
      <p>
        At Distrito Federal, we take pride in offering a truly memorable take on
        elevated and traditional Mexican cuisine. From our signature Enchiladas
        and tantalizing Molcajetes to our Specialty Tacos, every dish is crafted
        with care, flavor, and authenticity. Our menu is curated and executed by
        Chef Geo; Chef has been written about in multiple news articles due to
        his passion for creating bold, vibrant Mexican flavors ensures that
        every plate offers something more than meets the eye—a perfect balance
        of tradition, creativity, and taste.

      <h2>Bar</h2>
      <p>
        Since Distrito’s inception, our goal has been to craft extraordinary
        drinks using the freshest ingredients. As a standard, we process all
        juices in-house and prepare each cocktail with professional precision
        and care. Creating specialty drinks is our passion, and each one is
        designed to leave you with a memorable experience you’ll want to
        revisit. Some of our most popular selections include the Lucid Dream—a
        clarified pear and matcha cocktail; 24 Carrot—a tequila-based drink
        featuring freshly juiced carrot and habanero-infused honey; and our
        signature Mexican Carajillo, a beloved favorite among guests and staff
        alike. Reserve a spot or stop by today!
